How HubSpot Scaled AI Adoption

HubSpot's engineering team has turbocharged their AI adoption for coding, evolving from tentative trials with GitHub Copilot in 2023 to nearly full buy-in across the org by ditching initial guardrails and pushing for universal access. With executive backing and smart pilots involving whole teams, they measured real productivity boosts—modest at first, but growing as tools got smarter—while brushing off early skeptics with data and peer-shared success stories. To ramp up effectively, they spun up a dedicated Developer Experience AI team to handle everything from tool evaluations to customizing AI for their specific tech stack, making it a breeze for engineers to dive in without reinventing the wheel. For SMBs and MSPs eyeing similar moves, the key takeaway is to secure leadership support, run inclusive tests, and build internal champions to scale AI without the usual headaches, turning what started as a cautious experiment into a game-changing productivity engine that even paved the way for advanced features like their Sidekick AI assistant.
